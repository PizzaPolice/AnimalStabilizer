  <name>[1.4] Emergency Stabilizer</name>
  <description>Adds an implant that forces a pawn into a cryptosleep-like state when they reach critical condition, giving you more time to stop bleeding or respond to time-sensitve trauma. 
  
  Primarily meant for animals, so you don't have to play Trauma Team on Emergency mode every time your tank animals get downed. It has a number of cognitive consequences when you use it on a sapient pawn.
