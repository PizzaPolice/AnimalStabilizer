# AnimalStabilizer

A Mod for Rimworld that adds an implant that forces a pawn into a cryptosleep-like state when they reach critical condition, giving you more time to stop bleeding or respond to time-sensitve trauma.
  
Primarily meant for animals, so you don't have to play Trauma Team on Emergency mode every time your combat animals get downed. It has a number of cognitive consequences when used on a sapient pawn.
